# Product Mission (Lite)

VueSip is a headless Vue.js component library that helps Vue developers build professional SIP/VoIP applications by providing plug-and-play composables with deep customization options.

VueSip serves Vue.js developers and enterprise teams who need to add calling features to their applications without the complexity of WebRTC and SIP protocols. Unlike traditional SIP libraries with rigid UI components, VueSip provides pure business logic through composables while developers maintain complete control over their UI. The library uniquely combines client-side SIP functionality with server-side AMI integration for full Asterisk/PBX support.
